If it yields to pressure, it’s ripe. Easy, isn’t it? \\nPears do not ripen well on the tree. Pears are harvested when mature, but not yet ripe. Instead, they slowly reach maturity as they ripen from the inside out at room temperature. \\nHow do you know when the pear has ripened to sweet and juicy perfection? \\nWhile a Bartlett’s skin color brightens as it ripens, most varieties of pears show little change in color. \\nVarieties to Explore\\nBartlett \\nBosc \\nd’Anjou \\nNutrient Content Claims\\nFat free, Saturated fat free, Cholesterol free, Sodium free \\nHealth Claims \\nDietary Fat & Cancer: Development of cancer depends on many factors.

Be sure to check them daily to catch them at perfect ripeness. \\nYou can also arrange them in a fruit bowl and place them on the kitchen counter, dining room table, or even in the living room so you can enjoy their beauty as they ripen. If they are ripening at room temperature near other fruit, like bananas, the natural ethylene they give off will help speed up the ripening process. \\nTo Prevent Browning\\nLike many fruits, the flesh of cut or peeled pears will eventually brown. This natural oxidation process, however, does not affect the taste or quality. Browning can be slowed by “acidulating” the cut surfaces with a mild solution of 50% water and 50% lemon juice. Lightly poaching pears will also slow the browning and is a good way to prepare pears for use in salads.  \\nHow to ripen pears video \\nSERVE\\nPears Snacking – rule of two video  \\nTop 10 Ways to Enjoy Pears \\nVisit FruitsandVeggies.org for pear recipes!   \\nSAVOR\\nPresence in Ethnic Cuisines \\nAsian / South East Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos) / Mediterranean \\nSHARE\\nSocial Media Posts \\nDecember is National Pear Month, and  @fruitsandveggies is going to tell you all about them. http://ow.ly/ULYMA  #haveaplant \\nPears are packed w/ fiber, vitamins & minerals.
